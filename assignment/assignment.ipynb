        "**Q1.** This question provides some practice cleaning variables which have common problems.\n",
        "1. Numeric variable: For `./data/airbnb_hw.csv`, clean the `Price` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. How many missing values do you end up with? (Hint: What happens to the formatting when a price goes over 999 dollars, say from 675 to 1,112?)\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "When cleaning the price variable, I first chose to coerce the data all to a numeric type, then I created a new variable called 'Price_nan' which stores all the missing prices, then I turned all the missing price data to np.nan. I did this because if I chose a value like 0,1, or the median it would skew the mean and change the histogram. The total number of missing prices is 181.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing?\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "When clenaing the 'subject_injury' variable, I created an 'empty_subject_injury' variable which stored all the missing values in 'subject_injury'. I then replaced all the missing values in 'subject_injury' with np.nan as this is the best approach when working with yes/no qualitative data. I then printed the values and found that there are 9848 missing values compared to 3077 reported values. This is very concerning, as this means that the vast majority of police subjects in Minnesota are unknown whether they were injured or not which shows that Minnesota police may not be lawfully arresting citizens with reasonable force. Lastly, I cross tabulated both 'subject_injury' and 'empty_subject_injury' and saw that over 7000 bodily force types were not reported, which is concerning because bodily force type was the force type that resulted in the most injuries (1286 injuries)!\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "3. Dummy variable: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable as well as you can, and, in particular, replace missing values with `np.nan`.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "For this variable, 1 = true, 0 = false, and 9 = missing. So I replaced all the 9's with np.nan, there are 31 missing values.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "4. Missing values, not at random: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. (Hint: Look at the `SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent` variable.)\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "For cleaning the `ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent` variable I saw that it was a very messy string of arrays, so I coerced it to numeric and replaced empty values with np.nan. Then I looked at the min and max values and plotted the distribution and saw that their were obvious outliers for sentence length, so I did a log transformation to get rid of outliers while not deleting any data. I then plotted the distribution again and it looked a lot better. I then looked at the `SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent` variable and saw that it consisted of 5 categories: 0 = no sentence, 1 = jail/short-term, 2 = probation/community supervision, 4 = prison/long-term, 9 = missing. I then replaced the 9's with np.nan and renamed the other 4 variables as category types. I then printed out the clean values, and cross tabulated with the previous variable."

        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  The paper introduces a framework for data tidying, a subset of data cleaning that structures datasets for easier manipulation and analysis. It promotes a standard where each variable is a column and each observation is a row, enabling the creation of \"tidy tools\" that work together seamlessly.\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  The tidy data standard aims to simplify the process of initial data exploration and tool development. By providing a standard way to organize values, it eliminates the need to reinvent the wheel for every new dataset and reduces the time spent \"munging\" data between different analysis tools.\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  Wickham compares datasets to families: tidy datasets are \"all alike\" because they follow a strict standard, while every messy dataset is disorganized in its own unique way. He notes that while identifying variables in a specific project is intuitive, providing a universal definition is difficult because the role of data (as a variable or a value) often depends on the specific goals of the analysis.\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  Wickham defines values as the individual numbers or strings within a dataset. A variable consists of all values measuring the same attribute across different units, while an observation contains all values measured on a single unit across different attributes.\n",
        "  <br><br>  \n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  Tidy data is a standard mapping of semantics to structure where each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms its own table.\n",
        "  <br><br>  \n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  The five common problems are:<br>1. values in column headers<br>2. multiple variables in one column<br>3. variables in both rows and columns<br>4. multiple types per table<br>5. single types across multiple tables<br><br>Table 4 is messy because column headers represent income values rather than variable names. Melting is the process of turning these column headers into rows to create a \"molten\" dataset.\n",
        "  <br><br>  \n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because variables (days) are spread across columns and the \"element\" column contains names of variables like 'tmin' and 'tmax'. Table 12(a) is molten because it stacks the days into rows, but it only becomes truly tidy in Table 12(b) after the 'element' values are \"cast\" into their own individual columns.\n",
        "  <br><br>  \n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  <br><br>\n",
        "  The chicken-and-egg problem refers to the fact that tidy data is only useful if there are tools to handle it, but tools are only designed for tidy data. Wickham hopes future research will use human-computer interaction methods to improve the cognitive side of data analysis and develop tools that automatically optimize between different data storage formats."
